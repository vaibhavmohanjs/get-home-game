Perfect 👍
Here’s a **summary of your game so far** — you can show this to another chat so they know the current state without needing the full code:

---

## 🕹️ Current Game Features (Runner Game with Zombies)

### 🎮 Player

* Sprite-based character (`spritesheet_grant_running.png`) with **12 frames** of animation.
* Can **jump twice** (double jump).
* Has **slow fall** ability (when holding Space after max jumps).
* Frame rate slowed so animation looks smoother, not jittery.

### 🧟 Zombies

* Sprite-based zombies (`zomby.png`) with **6-frame animation**.
* Spawn randomly, alternating with holes.
* Zombies **grow bigger** with each spawn to increase difficulty.
* Can be destroyed if hit by a ball.

### 🕳️ Holes

* Three types: small, medium, large.
* Player dies if they fall in (collision only when actually centered over the hole, not too early).

### 🔴 Balls / Ammo

* Player starts with **5 balls**.
* Two throw modes:

  * **ENTER** → straight shot
  * **SHIFT + ENTER** → bouncing shot (affected by gravity & ground bounces).
* Balls **destroy zombies** on collision.
* Ammo decreases but currently **doesn’t refill yet** (that’s the next feature we’re fixing).

### 🌤️ Environment

* Moving clouds in the background.
* Green ground.
* Darkness effect: screen slowly darkens over time; moving forward (Arrow →) accelerates it. If it becomes fully dark → game over.

### 🏠 Win / Lose

* **Score system**:

  * Passing holes & zombies gives points.
  * Winning score = **1000 points**.
* On win → shows a cute **house image** with a congratulations message.
* On loss → “Game Over” screen with restart option.

### ⚡ Controls

* **SPACE** = jump (up to 2 jumps).
* **Arrow →** = sprint forward (but increases darkness faster).
* **ENTER** = throw ball.
* **SHIFT + ENTER** = bouncing ball throw.
* **SPACE on Game Over/Win screen** = restart game.

👉 Next unfinished feature:

* **Ammo refill system** (either automatic after cooldown, or collectable items).

Would you like me to also write a **clean “feature roadmap”** (with TODOs like “Add ammo refill, Add sound effects, Add levels” etc.) so the next chat can pick it up more easily?
